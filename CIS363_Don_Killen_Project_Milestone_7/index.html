						<p>Killenz 18th Scale Die-Cast Cars welcomes you to our unique model cars collector site! We hope you will enjoy
							the wide variety of 18th scale die-cast muscle cars we offer. We specifically cater to the 18th scale model car
							 collector specifically and 2) only carry die-cast metal cars-not those messy glue-and-paste plastic models kits.  
						</p>
						<p>Further, we only carry major muscle cars of the American culture (except exotics) that have shaped our lifestyles and fascinations
							with the big engines of the era of the late '50s through the early '70s. We hope to bring back your dreams of sports cars
							that moved cars in a big way with raging butimous, rattling horse power! Today cars are beginning to look all the same,
							and hard to differenciate and with no distinction-well we want to bring back the days of the cars that have make a name
							recognizabe and meant something and we bring you, the customer, some old but relished memories of those glory days!
							</p>	
						<p>We work hard to keep you up-to-date on the best collections of 18th scale die-cast cars from the major brands
						   like American Muscle, Mattel Hot Wheels, Kyosho and many other popular manufacturers. We carry three of the major
							American car manufacturers: Ford, Chevrolet, and Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth/American Motors.Look for the 
							links to each web page above. Also, we didn't forget about the exotic muscle car model collector either, by carrying 
							sports cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, and other wild breeds that we offer, which add to your 
							fascination with muscle car	power. We added a link for it too. So enjoy the site and choose a favorite muscle car of your choice
							and add it to your shopping cart purchase.</p> Thank You!!!
